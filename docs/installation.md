# Installation

With `wdi5` [being a service to WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/docs/wdio-ui5-service), installation of both is required.

`wdi5` can be used both in a [CJS-](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/modules.html) and an [ESM-](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/esm.html)environment.

## Prerequisites

- UI5 app running in the browser, accessible via `http(s)://host.ext:port`.
  Recommended tooling for this is either the official [UI5 tooling](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-tooling) (`ui5 serve`) or some standalone http server like [`soerver`](https://github.com/vobu/soerver) or [`http-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).
- UI5 app using UI5 >= `1.60` (because the [`RecordReplay` API](https://ui5.sap.com/sdk/#/api/sap.ui.test.RecordReplay) is used extensively which is only available from UI5 `1.60`+)
- Node.js version >= `18` (`lts/hydrogen`)

The installation of `wdi5` and WebdriverIO can either be done by using (a) `npm init wdi5`, (b) the [Webdriver.IO `cli`](https://webdriver.io/docs/gettingstarted.html) or (c) manually.

## a) quickstart with `npm init wdi5`

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **JavaScript**

```shell
$> cd any/ui5/app
$> npm init wdi5@latest
```

This will

- install `wdi5` and all required WebdriverIO peer dependencies
- add a config file (`wdio.conf.js`) to your current working directory,
  using `http://localhost:8080/index.html` as `baseUrl`,  
  looking for tests in `$ui5-app/webapp/test/**/*`
  that follow the name pattern `*.test.js`
- set an `npm` script named "wdi5" to run `wdi5`
  so you can immediately do `npm run wdi5`

#### **TypeScript**

```shell
$> cd any/ui5/app
$> npm init wdi5@latest -- --ts
# yeah, it's "-- --ts" b/c of the way
# `npm init` works:
# https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-init#forwarding-additional-options
```

This will

- install `wdi5` and all required WebdriverIO peer dependencies
- add config files (`wdio.conf.ts` + `tsconfig.json`) to a folder `test` in your current working directory
- uses `http://localhost:8080/index.html` as `baseUrl`,  
  look for tests to run in `$ui5-app/test/**/*`
  that follow the name pattern `*.test.js`
- set an `npm` script named "wdi5" to run `wdi5`
so you can immediately do `npm run wdi5`
<!-- tabs:end -->

Note this is a _minimal_ install for running `wdi5`

- locally
- with `Chrome` as target browser
- `mocha` as the syntax for tests
- `spec` as the output format of the test results

?> as of `create-wdi5` (the module "behind" `npm init wdi5`) `0.3.0`, you can now pass the options  
`--configPath <target path>` for a custom target directory to put `wdio.conf.(j|t)s` in  
`--specs <path glob>` the file sys/dir pattern to scan for test files
`--baseUrl <application url>` custom url to your application  
examples:  
`$> npm init wdi5@latest --configPath some/sub/folder/ \`
`--specs ./my/test/**/*.js \`
`--baseUrl http://localhost:4004/app/index.html`
`$> npm init wdi5@latest -- --ts --configPath some/other/folder/ \`
`--specs ./ts-tests/**/*.test.ts \`
`--baseUrl http://localhost:4004/ts-app/index.html`

:tada: Done! Proceed to [configuring wdi5](configuration) now.

## b) guided install via `wdio` cli

?> This step assumes that you have neither installed WebdriverIO nor `wdi5` previously for that UI5 app. If so, see [manual install](#manual-installation) below.

On the console, change into the folder with the UI5 app you want to test.

```shell
$> cd any/ui5/app
```

Then let the `@wdio/cli` guide you through the setup process, including installation of `wdi5` aka `wdio-ui5-service`.
(In this example, we'll do a minimum install for running `wdi5`/`wdio`

- locally
- with Chrome as target browser
- plain JavaScript as notation
- `mocha` as the syntax for tests
- `spec` as the output format of the test results

The variety of choices in the guided install should already give you a taste of how flexible `wdio` is!
)

```shell
$> npx wdio
```

Answer each step of the guided install subsequently.

!> Don't forget to check `ui5` at the stage "Do you want to add a service to your test setup?"

![toogle "ui5" for installing wdi5/wdio-ui5-service](./img/05_installation.png)

If you use the [ui5-tooling](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/) for serving your UI5 app under test, then the default base url is <http://localhost:8080>.

If your UI5 app lives on any other URL, put the the FQDN including the path right up to, but not including, `index.html` there, e.g. <https://ui5-app.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/some/sub/dir>

![base url of the ui5 app we want to test](./img/07_installation.png)

As the final step, let the cli do the `npm install` for you:

![end of the setup process does an "npm install"](./img/09_installation.png)

At the end of the guided installation, you'll be greated with a message similar to
`ðŸ¤– Successfully setup project at /Users/you/any/ui5/app ðŸŽ‰`

:arrow_right: Continue with the [configuration](configuration) now.

## c) manual installation

In case you already have a `wdio.conf.(j|t)s` file and WebdriverIO 8 installed, getting `wdi5` is a straightforward process.

In a terminal, change to the directory holding your `wdio` conf file.

```shell
$> cd any/ui5/app
```

Install `wdi5` with its' technical name `wdio-ui5-service`:

```shell
$> npm install --save-dev wdio-ui5-service
```

Add that service to the respective section in `wdio.conf.(j|t)s`:

```javascript
//...
services: [
  // ...
  "ui5"
]
//...
```

:tada: Done! Proceed to [configuring wdi5](configuration) now.

## reinitialize setup

If you have issues with your `wdio.conf.(j|t)s` file or want to reinitialize the guided installation:

```shell
$> npx wdio config
```
