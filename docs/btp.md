## Description

This is an example of an HTML5 app that is accessed by a managed application router and is integrated into the SAP Launchpad service. During the build process (`mbt build`), the app is compressed into a zip file. During the deployment (`cf deploy`), the HTML5 app is pushed to the HTML5 Application Repository and uses the Authentication & Authorization service (XSUAA service) and the destination service.

## Download and Deployment

1. Subscribe to the [SAP Launchpad service](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-portal-cloud-foundry-getting-started.html) if you haven't done so before.
1. Go to source code:

   ```sh
   cd examples/ui5-js-app
   ```

1. Build the project:

   ```sh
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

1. Deploy the project:

   ```sh
   cf deploy mta_archives/wdi5-test-app_1.0.0.mtar
   ```

1. See the URL of the web app:

   ```shs
   cf html5-list -di wdi5-test-app-destination-service -u --runtime launchpad
   ```

> Use the following command in case you use the Portal service
>
> `cf html5-list -di wdi5-test-app-destination-service -u --runtime cpp`
