## Prerequisites

- UI5 app running in the browser, accessbile via `http(s)://host.ext:port`.
  Recommended tooling for this is either the official [UI5 tooling](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-tooling) (`ui5 serve`) or some standalone http server like [`soerver`](https://github.com/vobu/soerver) or [`http-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).
- node version >= `12.x` (`lts/erbium`)
- (optional) `yarn`
  during development, we rely on `yarn`’s workspace-features - that’s why we refer to `yarn` instead of `npm` in the docs, even though using `npm` as an equivalent shold be fine too

## Installation

To keep the module lightweight, `wdio-ui5-service` has almost zero dependencies. Right now, until the switch to async, `@wdio/sync` is needed.
This means you have to setup `WebdriverIO` as a prerequisite as described in https://webdriver.io/docs/gettingstarted.html.

```bash
$> npm i --save-dev @wdio/cli
$> npx wdio config # do the config boogie - this will also install dependencies
```

Add `wdio-ui5-service` as a (dev)dependency to your `package.json` via

`$> npm install wdio-ui5-service --save-dev`
or
`$> yarn add -D wdio-ui5-service`

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "wdio-ui5-service": "^0.0.1"
  }
}
```

Then add the `ui5`-service to the standard `wdio.conf.js`:

```javascript
...
services: [
    // other services like 'chromedriver'
    // ...
    'ui5'
]
...
```

Finally, pass in configuration options for `wdi5` in your `WebdriverIO`-conf file:

```javascript
wdi5: {
    screenshotPath: require('path').join('test', 'report', 'screenshots'), // [optional] using the project root
    screenshotsDisabled: false, // [optional] {Boolean}; if set to true screenshots won't be taken and not written to file system
    logLevel: 'verbose', // [optional] error | verbose | silent
    platform: 'browser', // [mandatory] browser | android | ios | electron
    url: 'index.html', // [mandatory, not empty] path to your bootstrap html file. If your server autoredirects to a 'domain:port/' like root url use empty string ''
    deviceType: 'web', // [mandatory] native | web
    skipInjectUI5OnStart: false, // [optional] true when UI5 is not on the start page, you need to later call <wdioUI5service>.injectUI5(); manually
    waitForUI5Timeout: 15000 // [optional] maximum waiting time while checking for UI5 availability
}
```

See [test/wdio-ui5.conf.js](test/wdio-ui5.conf.js) for a sample configuration file for browser-scope testing.

Run the tests via the `webdriver.io`-cli:

```javascript
$> npx wdio
```

### Skip UI5/`wdi5` initialization on startup

In case the very first called page is non-UI5 (think SAP CP CloudFoundry login),
the config option `skipInjectUI5OnStart` can be set to `true` to postpone injecting `wdi5` into the `browser` context.
Consequentially you have to do it later, as soon as the UI5 page to test is available. This can be done by calling `injectUI5()` on the `wdio-ui5-service`.

```javascript
// require the service implementation and instantiate separately
const _ui5Service = require('wdio-ui5-service').default;
const wdioUI5Service = new _ui5Service();

await wdioUI5Service.injectUI5();
```

Check `/wdio-ui5-service/test/ui5-late.test.js` in conjunction with `/wdio-ui5-service/test/wdio-ui5-late.conf.js` for an example.

## Usage

Run-(Test-)Time usage of `wdi5` is agnostic to its' test-scope (browser or native) and centers around the global `browser`-object, be it in the browser or on a real mobile device.

Please see the top-level [README](../README.md#Usage) for API-methods and usage instructions.

## Features specific to `wdio-ui5-service` (vs. `wdi5`)

## Navigation

In the test, you can navigate the UI5 webapp via `goTo(options)` in one of two ways:

- updating the browser hash
  ```javascript
  await browser.goTo({sHash: '#/test'});
  ```
- using the UI5 router [navTo](https://openui5.netweaver.ondemand.com/api/sap.ui.core.routing.Router#methods/navTo) function
  ```javascript
  await browser.goTo(
      oRoute: {
          sComponentId,
          sName,
          oParameters,
          oComponentTargetInfo,
          bReplace
      }
  )
  ```
